# Images_Dimensionality_Reduction_PCA
Note: this is a solution for one of the assignments of the Introduction to Machine Learning course.


# Challenge
We have 5000 high quality face images that we want to store, but we also need to save space.

# Solution 
My solution was to implement PCA on them to perform dimensionality reduction. In addition, I implemented a code that can approximately recover the data by projecting them back onto the original high dimensional space.
